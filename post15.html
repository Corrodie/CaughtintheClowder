											<h2>Welcome!<br /></h2>

										<p><strong>T</strong>hanks for visiting! Welcome to Caught in the Clowder. I've wanted to create this blog for a while now, but never developed any specific ideas. There are a lot of things I’d like to talk about, but want to maintain a bit of structure rather than just submitting to a mindspill! I've decided to take the plunge, and have a list of subjects to cover now, but I'm happy to take recommendations over at our Facebook page! Anyway, I suppose I will introduce the blog to start!</p>
                                        <p><strong>I</strong>'ve been working with cats for five and a half years now, as a behavior consultant for guardians experiencing behavioral problems in their homes. As a shelter behavior coordinator, performing behavior assessments, creating plans, and performing clicker training to bring our cats out of their shells or break problem behaviors. I love what I do, but I've always wanted to educate more as a part of my day to day, as it's my favorite part of the job. I love questions, providing answers, seeing people put the pieces tobether and watching the lightbulb switch on overtop their heads! I enjoy the process of feeding information just as much as I love seeking it out and learning. So, to quell that desire, here we are!</p>

										<p><strong>C</strong>onsulting can be frustrating for me sometimes, as people can reach out for help but do not really want any of the possible remedies to their problems as it will require work on their part. “Why can’t you just fix the <strong><i>cat?</i></strong> Something’s wrong with <strong><i>him!</i></strong>” is the mindset, and they’re often so closed off to the information as to why the cat is presenting the behaviors they are in that specific moment. I’ve longed for a neutral space where I can help people before they’re on that ledge, because the internet is so full of harmful advice that is sought before they get to me. So, maybe this space can be that. Perhaps, one day, instead of WikiHow popping up and telling people to use spray bottles (Please, don’t!) this will be there instead.</p>
                                        <p><strong>S</strong>ound like a space you’re interested in following? Let’s do this! I’d love to hear if there are any specific cat issues, questions, anything cat-related at all that you might be curious about, want my opinion on, et cetera. I don’t want to isolate anyone by ranting about topics I’m particularly passionate about; as one specifically on my mind is the declaw ban in the works in my state. (I’m so excited, fingers crossed!) I have my personal social media for my passion-filled ranting like that! Overall, I’m open to talking about quite literally any feline-related topic that might be helpful. I may not be the ultimate authority, I may not have all of the answers all of the time, but I certainly have more than your typical google search. And, I can promise if I don’t have it, this aspie brain probably won’t allow sleep until it finds it!</p>
                                         <p><strong>T</strong>hanks for reading, please feel free to reach out with any thoughts, recommendations, or anything at all over at our Facebook page. I’m new to this blogging world and want to not only follow the concerns of my readers, but also grow and learn.<br><br>- Meg</p>

									<p>Hi, I’m Meg. A cat mom of 7 and, well, overall cat lady. I’d been pretty lost in life until back in 2016 I decided to start volunteering in animal welfare and very quickly developed a passion for feline behavior. I started learning everything I could – and still am. I began working in the field and now head the behavior department at my local shelter. I don’t get to simply educate as much as my aspie brain would like to, so, I thought, why not write about it?! And here I am.</p>
