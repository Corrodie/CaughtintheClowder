                                    </header>
                                    <p><strong>T</strong>his post is a compilation, a FAQ of sorts, covering questions and behaviors I see or am asked regularly about. Most of these aren’t problems, just normal things that us humans don’t quite “get” or concepts that aren’t really common knowledge. For some of them, we may know one application but not all. As you will learn, not all behaviors are clear cut with only one meaning! Today we’ll cover basic questions, talk about simple things like purrs and tail quivers, to goofy things like the Flehmen response, cats who dig to cover their food bowls or other household items, and many others. I’m going to rattle off a list of things I hear or see regularly here. I will add a disclaimer, though – we don’t necessarily have a precise answer for some of these yet! For those trickier ones, we have pretty great ideas that I think you can confidently subscribe to, at least until we learn more! So, let's get started!</p>
                                    <blockquote>What is catnip really doing to my cat? Is it safe? And why doesn’t his brother seem to care about it?</blockquote>
                                    <p><strong>T</strong>he essential oil contained within catnip, nepetalactone, elicits a variety of different effects in felines depending on their temperament and the environment in which they’re given it. It can stimulate appetite, calm them, excite them, increase aggression, or make them particularly amorous – but why? What is it actually doing? Nepetalactone, once it enters the nose or mouth, lights up a lot of signals in the amygdala and pituitary gland, activating the opioid systems and sending all of the happy chemicals to their brain for about 10 minutes, resulting in the “high” we’re all so familiar with. This is thought to be a sexual arousal above all, as cats typically do not respond to catnip until they are of reproductive age (4-6 months old.) It is perfectly safe, unless your cat is one of the rare few who does experience increased aggression with catnip exposure. It is worth noting, however, that they can build up a tolerance, so, if you (and your cat) really enjoy the experience, it’s best to do it with moderation! As for why some cats don’t respond, catnip sensitivity is hereditary, and it’s thought that between 40-60% of cat s are catnip responders. As a fun fact, recent studies have found that their infatuation with catnip may not just be for fun! Agitation to the plant leaves and subsequent release of oils onto the skin actually appears to repel mosquitoes – our feline friends are saving themselves from itchy bug bites!</p>
                                    <blockquote>Why does my cat act CRAZY when I scratch the base of his tail?</blockquote>
                                    <p><strong>S</strong>ome cats just do “elevator butt,” some lick themselves, you, or the air. Some howl and yowl, nibble, genuinely bite or become seriously aggressive! Some love it until they hate it and express the whole range of behaviors described. You may think you haven’t seen this, but I’m sure you have. Most cat video compilations have at least one clip of a cat, head held high and swinging back and forth making an almost “OMNOMNOM” noise with wild eyes. Usually they’re so close on the cat’s head you almost can’t see the hand aggressively scratching their behind – but nine times out of ten if you look closely, it’s there. But why is it causing them to do this? Well, a cat’s spine overall is very intricate and sensitive. There are so many nerve endings back there. On some cats, my boy Muttle is like this, the slightest touch on anything below the neck is a “lick spot” and even your hair touching their back can send them into a twitching frenzy. They can develop a neurological condition called hyperesthesia where these nerves go into overdrive, causing pain and distress – some cats even chewing portions of their tails off. Yikes! So, it’s no wonder that we can breach “Feels good” territory and enter “Feels bad!” zone in a matter of seconds. The base of the tail, especially, has some extra factors going for it. It’s a difficult place to effectively groom or scratch for most cats, especially with the epidemic levels of feline obesity, so having that area scratched can be heavenly for a cat who just can’t ever get there themselves. There are a particularly large cluster of nerve endings at the base of the tail (as the tail is just an extension of the spine!) which make it even more sensitive (and potentially painful) there. They also have scent glands back there – which we know cats love to use! It’s been said that scratching this area very well may be causing sexual frustration in some cats, as it simulates sensations of mating, particularly for females. I don’t think anyone is entirely sure on that one, but it could very well explain the odd vocalization and swift changes from amorous to aggressive behavior in some, I have seen the same in cats in heat! Ultimately, if they love it, do it. (But be gentle, please) If they seem distressed, don’t. If they land in the middle and seem to tolerate it for a while, keep it short and sweet!</p>    
                                    <blockquote>Why does my cat’s tail get stiff and shake sometimes?</blockquote>
                                    <p><strong>T</strong>his one is really fun but can confuse a lot of people. This behavior is most commonly associated with spraying, and I’ve seen so many people ask about it online and get that exact answer, but don’t be alarmed! If you’re not being sprayed, they’re not spraying! In most instances I see people ask about this behavior it’s the most innocent one – their cat is greeting them when they come home, excited about dinner, or really happy about being pet. In those instances it’s just that. The cat is really excited, they’re happy to see you! They're anticipating their yummy meal, really loving the way you touch them. A quivering tail can be a sign of excitement, a sign of spraying...and what else? The tail quiver can be ambiguous, as even if there is no urine, if they’re still backing up to objects or walls, tail quivering, then walking away – they’re indicating there is a stressor that creates the desire to do so and should be addressed. A twitchy tail in some other instances could be an indicator of anxiety/stress, although not typically this exact representation. This is a behavior that should always have you looking at the antecedent and behavior to figure out just what it means.</p>
                                    <blockquote>Sometimes my cat will smell things, then sit there with this really weird, disgusted face with his mouth open for a while afterwards….what is that? Does he think it stinks? Is it some sort of seizure?</blockquote>
                                    <p><strong>N</strong>one of the above! Well…maybe he thinks the item he smelled stinks, there’s really no telling unless he runs away or bops the item, but what you’re seeing here is simply the Flehmen response. This is shared by a few species, most notably the horse with their characteristic toothy “smiles.” The reason for this face is the Jacobson’s (or, Vomeronasal) organ. Most mammals (reptiles and amphibians, too) have them, including us! But the anatomy is different, so the response is different. For some, they have the same organ in the same spot, with the same ducts – like snakes – but they transfer the scent directly there and have no need to flehmen and leave their mouth open “inhaling” that scent. For us humans, it’s located in another place entirely. The vomeronasal organ, in cats, is located in the roof of the mouth, with ducts leading from the mouth to the nose. The purpose of this organ is to analyze scents and pheromones, particularly those of other cats. (Hence all of those scent glands and their urine communication! They can learn a lot just from smell!) They’ll become interested in something, smell it, and if it’s particularly interesting, they will open their mouths and inhale, then using their tongue to transfer the scent to those ducts to gain more information – often leaving them in that state of grimace. Why some stay like that for quite so long is a mystery – is it processing time? Maybe we’ll never know, but, you don’t need to worry! Feel free to be entertained. It’s a beautiful thing that should be cherished. I adore every flehmen I catch.</p>
                                    <blockquote>Why do my cats always smell each other’s butts? I know it’s often a greeting in the animal kingdom, but, they live in the same house…it’s just weird!</blockquote>
                                    <p><strong>W</strong>ell, you pretty much answered it – and it’s a great follow up to the last question. Cats can gain a lot of information about each other from smelling each other’s rear ends. It’s a wonderful means of communication for them. It’s first and foremost a greeting. “Hey, how are ya?!” The “how are ya” is actually literal – as they’re gleaning information from the anal glands and pheromones once again and may be able to detect if their friend is ill. There’s also information about temperament, mood, hormones – the whole gamut going on there. How they respond to this greeting can also be communication. A bold cat sniffs with no hesitation – a confident and friendly cat will graciously accept the greeting and return the gesture, otherwise interact, or simply walk by unbothered afterwards. A fearful and anxious cat, or one who is less dominant and unsure may flee from this interaction or become defensive. A more dominant cat may become aggressive, fighting the curious acquaintance away. There’s a lot to be said for this gesture, sono matter how you personally feel about it…let them be!</p>
                                    <blockquote>My cat hopped up on my bed and was kneading, but she bit me when I tried to pet her! What’s the deal! I thought kneading was a happy behavior?!</blockquote>
                                    <p><strong>N</strong>ot necessarily. Kneading is an ambiguous behavior. It typically means they’re happy, content, comfortable, showing affection – but it can also be a sign of stress or pain. It can be a self-soothing mechanism, it can also be a scent marking behavior. Kneading is soothing not just because it is rhythmic and repetitive, but it’s reminiscent of nursing from the mother cat. Cats aren’t sentimental like we are, but I believe there still is an instinctual comfort in some infantile behaviors. We use mammary pheromones in multi-cat diffusers and it appears, in my experience and that of many others, to often be more effective than the classic cheek pheromone. I think memory serves for something! But…I’m just spit-balling there. Your cat may have been stressed or overstimulated and looking to curl up somewhere and calm herself. She may have wanted to be near you, but you touching her sent her over the edge. She may be hurting, keep an eye on her and her behavior. If things seem untoward for some time, maybe it’s time for a vet check. And always…take the whole cat into account! We’ll be talking about body language and communication soon!</p>
                                    <blockquote>One of my cats purrs nonstop while the other doesn’t at all. Why do cats purr? Why don’t some? Does it mean the other isn’t happy?</blockquote>
                                    <p><strong>N</strong>ot necessarily, again! And…sometimes they are and you just can’t hear it! Maybe you can feel the rumble, but it's on a frequency you can't hear, as some are just louder than others. However, beyond that there is a lot to purring and sometimes there are cats that aren’t capable. Lions and tigers cannot – and some small cats have respiratory insufficiencies that make them incapable of doing so. It doesn’t mean your cat isn’t happy, he just may not be able to. On the other hand, there could be a chance he chooses to communicate happiness by other means such as body language or other vocalizations. Purring is a somewhat important developmental behavior that is not human-specific like meowing is, so it is odd to think of them choosing not to, but we don’t know everything! In all reality, we know very little when it comes to purring overall. We know some reasons why, we know benefits, we have ideas as to the importance of it – but we don’t even fully understand the mechanisms of it or the totality of why they do it, it’s still stumping researchers on many levels. As for why they do it, as we understand at least, purring is another ambiguous one. Purring, just like kneading, can be a sign of happiness and contentment, excitement, pain, stress, frustration, illness, and can actually be used to promote healing in both the cat itself, and the guardian due to its frequency. You heard me – purring is functional and therapeutic, for blood pressure, mental health, bone health, tissue repair, and beyond. Having a cat is probably a healthy choice! Purring, once again, requires you to look at the whole cat to get the “Why?” But more often than not, you’ve probably got a happy cat.</p>
                                    <blockquote>Why does my cat’s hair stand up on end?</blockquote>
                                    <p><strong>T</strong>his is another ambiguous one. This is called piloerection and it’s kind of like goosebumps in humans. This is simply something that happens in response to stimulation. They could be excited, they could be afraid, frustrated, playful – anything really. To tell you why, I’d need more information about their body language or what’s happening before or when their hair stands up – antecedent and behavior!</p>
                                    <blockquote>My cat is always trying to cover her food bowl, does she think her food smells like $#!%? What’s going on?</blockquote>
                                    <p><strong>I</strong>t’s really easy to think that, isn’t it? That’s the obvious connection! But not to fear, her dinner probably isn’t offensive. Unfortunately, though, there could be another problem lurking: Anxiety or territorial insecurity. Not necessarily, but it’s something to keep an eye on. Water – there could be more going on, too. So, let’s talk about it. Cats have an instinct to cover their resources to do two things: A. Cover their tracks and protect them from predators and B. Cover the item, mask the scent, and save it so they can return to it later – this is called caching. Your cat could be exhibiting either or both of these behaviors. Maybe it is done for now and wants to come back later, or maybe it’s very territorially insecure and wants to protect everything from incoming threat. My boy Stache quite literally digs over anything he thinks is important, or any form of bowel movement or internal fluid. My food, his and his sibling’s food, dirty dishes, treats he doesn’t want, piles of vomit. My coffee. (Coffee specifically, because I always have some. He’s learned I love it.) Commonly worn items of clothing if they end up on the floor – anything. The funny part is, he’s REALLY bad at covering his stuff in the litter box. He tries, really hard. He will stand there and dig for 10 minutes, never covering appropriately. Scratching the walls, scratching the floor 2 feet away from the box – while one of his siblings goes and covers his stuff for him. He’s very anxious and insecure, and I’ve seen this pretty commonly in cats who exhibit other territorial or anxiety driven behavioral problems – guardians describe similar anxious covering or caching behaviors, so I think this is a very good warning sign, even if overall caching is a normal, instinctual behavior. In general you don’t need to worry about it, but if it’s becoming a problem, the best way to combat food bowl digging is to stop free feeding. Switch to scheduled feedings (And I’d personally recommend wet-only feeding!) in a shallow dish or saucer, then pick up the dish once they’re done eating. There’s nothing to cache, so there’s no problem, no anxiety to be had. Now, what about water bowls? This can be the same territorial issue, but there can also be more going on. Cats have poor vision, believe it or not, so water in a bowl kind of sucks. They also have super sensitive whiskers, so bowls with rounded sides that always press up against them also suck – whisker fatigue is a real thing and it can be painful! Instinctually, cats may think that stagnant water isn’t really safe to drink, and may choose to play in it instead – or be creative and make it move before drinking it. (Interesting logic, but, I’ll bite, kids!) Sometimes, water is just fun. The point here is….bowls just aren’t great for cats, and I don’t recommend them. Saucers or slow/puzzle feeders/licki mats for food, fountains for water – always – that’s what you’ll hear from me, with no exceptions. I don’t believe in dry food, I don’t believe in free feeding, I don’t believe in stagnant water. Point blank. If your cat is upending the water bowl, and maybe they have a fascination for the toilet or sink, pick up a fountain – I bet it will get better!</p>
                                    <blockquote>Why does my cat always put toys and blankets in her food and water bowls? I’m constantly rescuing drowned toy mice. It’s like she’s making sacrifices to some cat God or something!</blockquote>
                                    <p><strong>T</strong>his one is super fun! My first cat was a major offender, walking around for hours with his favorite toy, howling and yowling before drowning it in the bowl or fountain…it really did seem like some sort of cultist activity, me and my mother had a riot at the time! But not to worry, your cat is not performing some crazy ritual, don’t pull out the sage. (but do continue the jokes, by all means.) This is another instinctual  response, somewhat related to caching! Your cat sees the areas where their food and water are located as safe spaces andreally loves those toys, so  naturally, is placing them in those safe spaces to protect them from predators. Sometimes it’s not just about the items, it’s the smell on them…they’re protecting the things that are important to the people they care about, and it’s beautiful. They don’t understand water damage, they just understand that…in their natural environment, they’d be lessening the chances of another animal coming and hurting that resource. (Or you, them!) So, as annoying as it is, let them do their thing. Put their fountain or bowl on top of an absorbent mat if it’s causing overflow…keep an eye on it. It’s a normal behavior.</p>
                                    <p><strong>T</strong>hat was a fun one, at least for me! I like these little behaviors – it’s a nice break from deep diving! There are so many ways that cats manage to pique our curiosity...I'd love to do more of these! But for now, this'll do.<br><br><strong>U</strong>ntil next time.<br><br><strong>-M</strong>eg.</p>

									<p>Hi, I’m Meg. A cat mom of 7 and, well, overall cat lady. I’d been pretty lost in life until back in 2016 I decided to start volunteering in animal welfare and very quickly developed a passion for feline behavior. I started learning everything I could – and still am. I began working in the field and now head the behavior department at my local shelter. I don’t get to simply educate as much as my aspie brain would like to, so, I thought, why not write about it?! And here I am.</p>
